Notes: 

- Independence
- Degrees of freedom
- significant therefore good fallacy - anecdote about undergrads

Different types of outliers - experimenter error, participant error or misreporting, natural variability. It might be very difficult to identify the first two, and the last one should not be removed. For participant error, example of age where parents report age in month rather than years - if it can be reliably checked against date of birth, then it should be corrected. 

Outliers cause the mean to have large standard deviation and therefore lower power. 

Regarding trimming - observations left after trimming are dependent, which invalidates the derivation of the test statistic.
