Martina Sladekova is a Doctoral Researcher in Psychology at the University of Sussex studying the statistical practice of psychology researchers with a specific focus on the application of [robust statistical methods](/project_info/proj_robust) as a means of improving the credibility of findings in psychology. 

Martina's PhD research combines a range of methodologies, including large-scale [reanalyses of existing research data](/project_info/proj_shape_of_data), [natural language processing with machine learning](/project_info/proj_nlp), data simulation, and [online surveys of statistical practice](/project_info/proj_stats_practice). You can visit the [Projects](/project/) page to learn more. 

Martina also work as a Psychology Technician at the University of Brighton where she support the research of psychology staff and students. Martina's work as a technician combined with her PhD research allows her to critically study the statistical models commonly used in psychology while also remaining conscious of the challenges the applied researchers face when adopting new statistical methods.
