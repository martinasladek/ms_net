# Data and Models in Psychology
##### Sladekova, M., Jakeman, H., Field, A. P.

**Stage:** Data analysis completed for a pilot study. 

Psychology researchers routinely utilise General Linear Models (GLM) as part of their statistical analyses. GLMs use Ordinary Least Squares estimation, which relies on a number of statistical assumptions in order to produce accurate and efficient estimates. With outliers present in the sample, the estimates become biased, while violations of normality and heteroscedasticity can lead to inefficiency and a loss of statistical power. 

This study has two main goals. First, we want to find out to find out what the data and models in psychology look like - what does the typical distribution of residuals look like, and how common are outliers? 

Second, we want to estimate the potential impact these characteristics may have on OLS estimates - to what extent to the OLS estimates change when the models are re-fitted with alternative robust estimators that don't rely on the same statistical assumptions? 

We are collecting data from public repositories linked to published papers as well as preprints on [PsyArxiv](https://psyarxiv.com). At a later stage, we will be contacting researchers who have previously expressed interest in providing some of their data. 

We're also interested in datasets that didn't make it through the publication process and remain hidden in the researchers' file drawers. If you think you might be interested in contributing some of your data, [get in touch!](#contact) We'd love to hear from you.
